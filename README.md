##Overview

The Sheet Music Catalog system is divided into three main sections or modules:

- Web frontend: PHP based web interface that allows users to search for and retrieve records.
- Search backend: Solr instance that is queried to allow for complex faceted searches.
- Admin backend: allows for the creation and deletion of records as well as the administration of users and headings. Also includes functionality for export.
